# igdb-search

IGDB Search is a small app that allows the user to search for a video game and get information about it on a single page.

## Motivation

This app was built to learn how to make a react app including the front-end (`client/` folder) and the back-end (`server/` folder) as well as using an API to fetch data.

## Libraries and Technologies

<b>Development</b>

- [Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)
- [React](https://fr.reactjs.org/)
- [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/)
- [ExpressJS](https://expressjs.com/fr/)
- [SwiperJS](https://swiperjs.com/)
- [IGDB API](https://www.igdb.com/api)

<b>Deployment</b>

- [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/) (front-end)
- [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/) (back-end)

I also wanted to test [ESLint](https://eslint.org/) and [Prettier](https://prettier.io/) to make my own opinion about these tools. Note that ESLint has been removed from the repository now.

## Usage

The application is available [here](https://igdb-search.netlify.app)

If you want to clone the project and run it on your own (localhost), you have to know that the application hosted here has not been made easier to use in that way yet because the server is currently accepting only the requests coming from the hosted app above.
If you really want to do so, it's not hard but you'll have to modify some values on both client and server sides to make it work from local addresses.

It may be fixed later and some description will be added here to reuse it easily.
